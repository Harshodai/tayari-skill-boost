# Tayari Skill Boost — Local Parallel Development Lessons

This document details key findings, architectural decisions, and lessons learned while configuring the local development stack of Tayari Skill Boost to run concurrently in parallel with another local self-hosted stack.

## 🏗 Parallel Stack Port Remapping & Bind Conflicts

When running multiple containerized architectures that rely on heavy self-hosted middleware (such as Supabase, Kong API Gateway, and custom Go/Python backends), port binding collisions on host adapters will prevent startups.

### Remapping Strategy

To enable simultaneous execution with your active **Mukthi Guru** containers, we successfully isolated and mapped all exposed host ports of Tayari Skill Boost to unoccupied alternatives:

| Service | Container Name | Host Port | Internal Port | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vite Frontend** | `tayari-frontend` | **4175** | `4173` | React static site preview |
| **Go Backend** | `tayari-backend-go` | **8085** | `8080` | Core API logic |
| **Python AI** | `tayari-backend-ai` | **8002** | `8001` | Resume optimizer & mock interviews |
| **Supabase Kong** | `supabase-kong` | **8008** | `8000` | API gateway / Reverse Proxy |
| **Supabase Studio** | `supabase-studio` | **3005** | `3000` | Local Supabase DB admin panel |
| **Supabase Postgres** | `supabase-db` | **54326** | `5432` | Self-hosted database |

### Architectural Insights
1. **Host Port vs Internal Network**: Containers inside their respective isolated Docker Compose networks communicate using default internal service names and ports (e.g. `db:5432` or `kong:8000`) without collision; only host-exposed port mappings conflict.
2. **Supabase Gotrue Redirects**: GoTrue manages OAuth callbacks and redirect URLs. When remapping the Kong gateway port (`8000` -> `8008`), all callback URLs (e.g. Google/Github/LinkedIn redirects, `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, `API_EXTERNAL_URL`) defined in `docker-compose.yml` MUST be updated to point to the new port (`http://localhost:8008`) instead of the defaults.
3. **Environment Alignment**: Frontend and backend `.env` variables must strictly match the remapped host ports (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:8008`, `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8085/api`, and `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4175` with matching CORS origins) to ensure smooth client connections and prevent preflight CORS check failures.

## ⏱ Database Migration Healthcheck Latency on First Boot

On the first-ever startup of a self-hosted Supabase DB instance, the database container boots and the GoTrue/Auth container runs a massive list of core database migrations (65 migrations in our case) to set up tables and functions.

### The Gotcha
* Running these migrations took about **26.7 seconds** to complete.
* Under strict healthcheck rules (e.g. `retries: 3`, `interval: 5s` = 15 seconds max), the container is prematurely flagged as unhealthy before migrations complete.
* This causes Docker Compose to abort the startup of downstream services that list the Auth service as a dependency.

### The Remedy
1. Allow more generous healthcheck grace periods or retries inside `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Or, run `docker compose up -d` a second time. Since database tables are already initialized, subsequent container startups are immediate, passing the health checks instantly and spinning up all downstream dependencies seamlessly.
